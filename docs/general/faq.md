# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where are Babel, ESLint and stylelint configured?

In package.json

## Where are the files coming from when I run `$ npm start`?

In development Webpack compiles your application runs it in-memory. Only when
you run `$ npm run build` will it write to disk and preserve your bundled
application across computer restarts.

## How do I fix `Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3000`?

This simply means that there's another process already listening on port 3000.
The fix is to kill the process and rerun `npm start`.

### OS X / Linux:

1. Find the process id (PID):
    ```Shell
    $ ps aux | grep node
    ```
    > This will return the PID as the value following your username:
    > ```Shell
    > $ janedoe    29811  49.1  2.1  3394936 356956 s004  S+    4:45pm   2:40.07 node server
    > ```

1. Then run
    ```Shell
    $ kill -9 YOUR_PID
    ```
    > e.g. given the output from the example above, `YOUR_PID` is `29811`, hence
    that would mean you would run `kill -9 29811`

### Windows

1. Find the process id (PID):
    ```Shell
    C:\> netstat -a -o -n
    ```

    > This will return a list of running processes and the ports they're
    listening on:
    > ```
    > Proto     Local Address     Foreign Address   State       PID
    > TCP       0.0.0.0:25        0.0.0.0:0         Listening   4196
    > ...
    > TCP       0.0.0.0:3000      0.0.0.0:0         Listening   28344
    ```

1. Then run
    ```Shell
    C:\> taskkill /F /PID YOUR_PID
    ```
    > e.g. given the output from the example above, `YOUR_PID` is `28344`, hence
    that would mean you would run `taskkill /F /PID 28344`

## Local webfonts not working for development

In development mode CSS sourcemaps require that styling is loaded by blob://,
resulting in browsers resolving font files relative to the main document.

A way to use local webfonts in development mode is to add an absolute
output.publicPath in webpack.dev.babel.js, with protocol.

```javascript
// webpack.dev.babel.js

output: {
  publicPath: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
  /* â€¦ */
},
```
